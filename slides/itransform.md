 * @brief Overview of the assembly implementation of the `transform` function.
 *
 * ## Assembly Transform Overview
 *
 * The `transform` module provides an assembly-based implementation of a generic `transform` function for arrays. The function iterates through an array of elements and applies a user-supplied function (functor) to each element, modifying it in place or storing the result in a destination array.
 *
 * ### Key Features
 *
 * - **Assembly-Based Implementation**: The `transform` function is implemented in ARM assembly, making it highly efficient for use in embedded systems with resource constraints.
 * - **Generic Array Manipulation**: The function operates on arrays of integers and can be adapted for different data types by using various functors.
 * - **User-Defined Functors**: The `transform` function accepts a function pointer (functor) as an argument, allowing the user to define custom operations on the array elements, such as mathematical transformations or randomized values.
 *
 * ### Major Functions
 *
 * - **`transform`**:
 *   - Applies a user-defined function (functor) to each element in an array.
 *   - Operates on integer arrays and allows custom transformations such as doubling values or generating random numbers.
 *
 * - **`rand_wrapper`**:
 *   - A helper function that provides a random integer value to be used as a functor with `transform`.
 *
 * ### Function Descriptions
 *
 * - **`transform(int* a, const size_t count, int (*functor)(int))`**:
 *   - Iterates through an array of integers, applying the provided function to each element.
 *   - Parameters:
 *     - `int* a`: Pointer to the array of integers.
 *     - `const size_t count`: Number of elements in the array.
 *     - `int (*functor)(int)`: Function pointer (functor) that defines the operation to be applied to each element.
 *
 * - **`rand_wrapper()`**:
 *   - A wrapper around the standard `rand` function that generates a random integer value.
 *   - The generated random value is shifted and masked to ensure it is within a certain range.
 *
 * ### Assembly Implementation Details
 *
 * - The `transform` function:
 *   - Saves the context of the registers using the `stmfd` (store multiple full descending) instruction.
 *   - Iterates through the array using a loop, applying the user-defined function to each element.
 *   - Writes the modified value back to the array or to a separate destination array.
 *   - Restores the context of the registers and returns.
 *
 * - The `rand_wrapper` function:
 *   - Calls the standard `rand` function from the C library.
 *   - Uses the `lsr` (logical shift right) instruction to reduce the range of the random value.
 *   - Returns the modified random value to the caller.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * ```assembly
 * // Assembly snippet to use the transform function with a random number generator
 * mov r0, #array_address   // Address of the array
 * mov r1, #array_size      // Number of elements in the array
 * mov r2, #rand_wrapper    // Address of the random number generator function
 * bl transform             // Call the transform function
 * ```
 *
 * ### Summary
 * The `transform` module provides a highly efficient assembly implementation of a generic transform function for array manipulation. By leveraging user-defined functors, the function can be customized to perform a wide range of operations on array elements, making it versatile for embedded system applications.

### Assembly `transform` Function: `transform.s`

**Purpose**:  
The `transform` function in `transform.s` is an assembly-implemented function designed to apply a transformation to each element of an array. It accepts a function pointer (`pred`) that specifies the operation to be performed on each element. This design is similar to higher-order functions in C and C++, making it highly flexible and allowing the user to define the transformation dynamically.

### Key Features

1. **Function Pointer-Based Transformation**:  
   The `transform` function iterates through the array and applies a user-provided transformation function (`pred`) to each element. This allows for operations such as generating random values, applying mathematical transformations, or other custom modifications.

2. **Flexibility and Generic Design**:  
   The function operates on an integer array, but by changing the function pointer passed to `transform`, a wide range of operations can be applied, including generating random numbers, adding a constant value to each element, or performing any element-wise transformation.

3. **Integration with the C Library `rand` Function**:  
   A wrapper function `rand_wrapper` is included to demonstrate how to use the C library's `rand` function within an assembly routine. This wrapper generates a random value and shifts it to fit within a smaller range, demonstrating how to handle common C library functions in assembly.

### Assembly Implementation Details

1. **Register Usage**:
   - **`r0`**: Pointer to the base address of the array.
   - **`r1`**: Number of elements in the array (count).
   - **`r2`**: Function pointer to the transformation function (`pred`).
   - **`r9`**: Loop counter.
   - **`r6`, `r7`, `r8`**: Saved values for the array, length, and function pointer, respectively.

2. **Algorithm Flow**:
   - The function first checks if the length of the array is zero. If it is, it exits immediately (`moveq   pc, lr`).
   - It then saves the base address of the array (`r0`), the length of the array (`r1`), and the function pointer (`r2`) into registers `r6`, `r7`, and `r8`, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over each element in the array, calling the function pointer (`blx r8`) for each element and storing the result back into the array at the corresponding position.
   - The loop terminates when all elements have been processed.

3. **Calling the Function Pointer**:
   - The assembly instruction `blx r8` is used to call the function pointer (`pred`) provided by the user. This demonstrates how to work with function pointers in assembly, allowing dynamic behavior.

4. **Random Number Generation (`rand_wrapper`)**:
   - The `rand_wrapper` function calls the C `rand` function to generate a random number, shifts it right by 20 bits (`lsr r4, r4, #20`), and returns the modified value.
   - This wrapper can be passed to `transform` as a function pointer to populate an array with random values.

### Example C Usage

This assembly function can be called from C code like this:

```c
// Example C function to use with `transform`
int generate_random(int dummy) {
    return rand() >> 20;  // Generates a random number and reduces its range
}

int main() {
    int array[10];
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    // Populate the array with random values using the assembly `transform` function
    transform(array, size, generate_random);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", array[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Usage Example in Assembly
Suppose we want to populate an array with random values using `transform` in assembly. The following C code will use `transform.s`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern void transform(int* a, size_t count, int (*pred)(int));

// Wrapper function to match the function pointer signature
int rand_wrapper(int dummy) {
    return rand() >> 20;  // Generate and reduce the range of random number
}

int main() {
    int array[10];
    transform(array, 10, rand_wrapper);  // Call assembly transform with rand_wrapper

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", array[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary
The `transform` function in `transform.s` provides a powerful and flexible way to apply transformations to an array using function pointers in assembly. It serves as a demonstration of how to implement generic algorithms in ARM assembly language and integrate C library functions. The use of function pointers and assembly-level manipulation highlights the performance and flexibility of assembly programming in embedded systems and specialized applications.
