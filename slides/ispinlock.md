 * @brief Overview of the assembly implementation of a spinlock for synchronization.
 *
 * ## Assembly Spinlock Overview
 *
 * The `spinlock` module provides an assembly-based implementation of a basic spinlock mechanism. This spinlock is designed to be used in multi-threaded or interrupt-driven environments where simple, low-level synchronization is required. The implementation leverages ARM instructions such as `ldrex` and `strex` to perform atomic memory operations and achieve thread-safe locking.
 *
 * ### Key Features
 *
 * - **Atomic Memory Operations**: The spinlock uses the ARM `ldrex` (load exclusive) and `strex` (store exclusive) instructions to perform atomic read-modify-write operations, ensuring safe access to shared resources.
 * - **Busy-Wait Loop**: The lock operation uses a busy-wait loop, meaning that the calling thread or function will spin until the lock is acquired, making it suitable for scenarios where the lock is expected to be held only briefly.
 * - **Simple and Lightweight**: The spinlock implementation is minimalistic, using only a few assembly instructions, and is ideal for low-overhead synchronization in real-time or embedded systems.
 * - **Educational Purpose**: Demonstrates how ARM assembly language can be used to implement synchronization primitives.
 *
 * ### Major Functions
 *
 * - **`spinlock_wait`**:
 *   - Waits until the lock is acquired.
 *   - Uses a busy-wait loop and atomic instructions to safely decrement the lock counter.
 *
 * - **`spinlock_signal`**:
 *   - Releases the lock.
 *   - Uses atomic instructions to safely increment the lock counter.
 *
 * ### Function Descriptions
 *
 * - **`spinlock_wait(int *count)`**:
 *   - Decrements the lock counter atomically using `ldrex` and `strex`.
 *   - Spins (waits) until the counter reaches zero, indicating the lock is available.
 *   - Parameters:
 *     - `int *count`: Pointer to the lock counter variable.
 *
 * - **`spinlock_signal(int *count)`**:
 *   - Increments the lock counter atomically using `ldrex` and `strex`.
 *   - Signals that the lock has been released and is available.
 *   - Parameters:
 *     - `int *count`: Pointer to the lock counter variable.
 *
 * ### Assembly Implementation Details
 *
 * - The `spinlock_wait` function:
 *   - Uses the `ldrex` instruction to load the lock counter value atomically.
 *   - Decrements the counter and attempts to store it back using the `strex` instruction.
 *   - If the store fails (another thread has modified the value), it repeats the operation.
 *   - When the counter reaches zero, the lock is acquired, and the function returns.
 *
 * - The `spinlock_signal` function:
 *   - Uses `ldrex` to read the lock counter.
 *   - Increments the counter to signal the lock release.
 *   - Stores the updated value back using `strex`.
 *   - If the store fails, it repeats the operation until successful.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * ```assembly
 * // Assembly snippet to use the spinlock functions
 * mov r0, #1         // Address of the lock counter
 * bl spinlock_wait   // Acquire the lock
 * // Critical section code here
 * bl spinlock_signal // Release the lock
 * ```
 *
 * ### Summary
 * The `spinlock` module provides a simple and effective assembly implementation of a spinlock for synchronization in embedded or real-time systems. By utilizing atomic instructions, it ensures safe access to shared resources and demonstrates the use of ARM assembly for synchronization primitives.

### Assembly `spinlock` Implementation: `spinlock.s`

**Purpose**:  
The `spinlock.s` file provides an implementation of a simple spinlock mechanism using ARM Cortex-M assembly language. The functions `spinlock_wait` and `spinlock_signal` offer a basic mutual exclusion mechanism that can be used in multithreaded or interrupt-driven environments to protect shared resources. This implementation leverages ARMâ€™s exclusive load (`ldrex`) and exclusive store (`strex`) instructions, which are designed specifically for implementing atomic operations and spinlocks.

### Key Features

1. **Spinlock Wait (`spinlock_wait`)**:
   - The `spinlock_wait` function attempts to acquire the spinlock by decrementing a counter variable (`*count`).
   - The function continuously tries (spins) until it successfully decrements the counter to indicate ownership of the lock.
   - If another process or thread has the lock (indicated by a non-zero value), `spinlock_wait` will keep trying until the lock is released.

2. **Spinlock Signal (`spinlock_signal`)**:
   - The `spinlock_signal` function releases the spinlock by incrementing the counter variable (`*count`).
   - It ensures that the update is successful using the exclusive store (`strex`) instruction and checks the result. If the update fails, it retries.

3. **ARM-Specific Instructions**:
   - **`ldrex`**: Load Exclusive Register. Loads the value from the address and sets an exclusive monitor flag.
   - **`strex`**: Store Exclusive Register. Attempts to store the value if the monitor flag is still set, returning a status value (success or failure).
   - The exclusive monitor flag allows implementing atomic read-modify-write sequences without using hardware interrupts or disabling preemption.

### Detailed Analysis of the Assembly Implementation

1. **`spinlock_wait` Function**:

   - **Line 1 (`ldrex r1, [r0]`)**: Load the current value of the counter (`*count`) from the memory address in `r0` into register `r1`. This sets an exclusive monitor, ensuring that no other `ldrex` instruction can access the same address until a corresponding `strex` is performed.
   - **Line 2 (`subs r1, #1`)**: Decrement the counter (`*count`) by 1, indicating an attempt to acquire the lock. The condition flags in the Program Status Register (PSR) are set as a result of this subtraction operation.
   - **Line 3 (`itt pl`)**: Set up an "If-Then-Then" conditional block based on the "positive or zero" condition flag (`pl`). This condition is true if the counter is non-negative.
   - **Line 4 (`strexpl r2, r1, [r0]`)**: Store the decremented counter back to the original memory address in `r0` if the previous instruction was successful (indicated by the "pl" flag).
   - **Line 5 (`cmppl r2, #0`)**: Compare the return value of `strexpl` to zero. If zero, it means the exclusive store was successful, and the lock was acquired.
   - **Line 6 (`bne spinlock_wait`)**: If the exclusive store was not successful (`r2` != 0), branch back to `spinlock_wait` and retry the operation, spinning until the lock is acquired.
   - **Line 7 (`bx lr`)**: Branch and exchange to return from the function, indicating the lock has been successfully acquired.

2. **`spinlock_signal` Function**:

   - **Line 1 (`ldrex r1, [r0]`)**: Load the current value of the counter (`*count`) from the memory address in `r0` into register `r1`.
   - **Line 2 (`add r1, #1`)**: Increment the counter by 1, indicating that the lock is being released.
   - **Line 3 (`strex r2, r1, [r0]`)**: Store the incremented counter back to the original memory address. If the store is successful (`r2` == 0), the lock has been released.
   - **Line 4 (`cmp r2, #0`)**: Compare the return value of `strex` to zero to check if the exclusive store was successful.
   - **Line 5 (`bne spinlock_signal`)**: If the exclusive store was not successful (`r2` != 0), branch back to `spinlock_signal` and retry the operation, spinning until the lock is released.
   - **Line 6 (`bx lr`)**: Return from the function, indicating the lock has been successfully released.

### Usage Example in C

Suppose we have the following C code that interacts with the `spinlock_wait` and `spinlock_signal` functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern void spinlock_wait(int *count);
extern void spinlock_signal(int *count);

int lock = 1;

void critical_section() {
    printf("Entering critical section...\n");
    // Perform operations in the critical section
    printf("Exiting critical section...\n");
}

int main() {
    // Wait until we can acquire the lock
    spinlock_wait(&lock);

    // Perform operations in the critical section
    critical_section();

    // Release the lock
    spinlock_signal(&lock);

    return 0;
}
```

### Summary

The `spinlock.s` file provides a basic spinlock implementation using ARM Cortex-M assembly language. It leverages ARM's exclusive load (`ldrex`) and exclusive store (`strex`) instructions to implement atomic operations, making it suitable for protecting shared resources in concurrent environments. This implementation is useful for learning how to create efficient synchronization primitives at the assembly level and serves as a building block for more complex locking mechanisms. The integration with C code allows for flexible use in various applications, including real-time and embedded systems.
